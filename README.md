### Compact MIDI controller

FuniFi Midistik is a compact, programmable MIDI controller for synthesisers. There is a popular ATtiny85 microcontroller in the heart of the device which can be progrmmed with Arduino IDE or just sending a wav file of the precompiled code using Audiobootloader. A collection of example patches are available via the Funi-fi Github repository.or sending analog voltages via 12Bit DAC and protective OpAmp. The device plugs directly in to MIDI in port (different soldering options for various MIDI port locations) and is powered by rechargeable LiPo battery. Board is populated with SMD parts, but soldering it by hand is not challenging.

### How to get it

There will be DIY kits available when next round of testing has cleared some concerns. The circuit can be build on breadboard very easily for the hasty & geeky ones. If you would be interested in beta testing either the soldering, or coding, or both, don't hesitate to contact.

### Bill of Materials

Coming soon

### Open hardware
Funifi CiiVIi is open source hardware and open source software, in short do whatever you like with them, as long as you share your derivatives under same granted freedom.

### Proto-alert
Use at yuour own risk, no guarantee can be granted for unikely but possible damage to the device itself or where it is connected. CiiVii is a prototype. It has been tested but there is a lot of room for improvement. Below are few issues on the todo list. All tips & suggestions welcome.

- touch pads needs developing, not yet implemented
- reliable debounced button coded is missing
- Alternative powering option for LiPo, "phantom" MIDI power from external MIDI out for the audio socket ring connection?
